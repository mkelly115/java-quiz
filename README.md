# java-quiz

The purpose of this project was to create a JS powered quiz that would be interactive and allow the user to not only see their score but save it locally as well (allowing a high-score list). I broke this project down into multiple looping functions to allow it to work in a reasonable fashion.

When users login to the webpage, a JS created div will create the start page that allows a user to either check high scores or begin the quiz. The quiz is timed with a penalty of 5 seconds for each wrong answers using an if statement to subtract from the stored value of time. The page will then tell the user correct or incorrect before moving on to the next. After the quiz is finished it will say congratulations the quiz has been completed with an option to save the user score locally or retry the quiz. (There is a failstate if the user reaches zero seconds).

## Usage
This quiz is made so a user can test their knowledge of javascript and then save their score to compare against other players of the game. The quiz comes equiped with a local storage high score as well as multiple responses for each question using radio buttons to select the user input.


## Conclusion
This project was the toughest test of my ability to internalize information learned in class yet. I had to utilize a wealth of resources including a friend who helped to gently push me in the correct direction on some of the many problems that I encounted during my time coding this quiz.

A combination of outside help and internet searching led me to learn three new features of JS that we had not gone over completely in class.

I learned now to to define a variable within a string by using the $ key. It is called string interlopation within template literals.

I learned about turnary operators and how the ? will allow me to shorthand if else statments (within the context of my project it applied to true and false statements).

With help I was able to understand at a base level the use of slice() in relation to saving a copy of an array to the DOM.

Overall I would contend that I have improved heavily in my understanding of JavaScript. One of my biggest takeaways was finding a new way of breaking down the project into tiny functions or small steps I needed to take. Rather than look at the big picture I would ask myself "What do I need to do next?" and the response was not an entire JS webpage but instead "I need this user click to wipe the page of JS". This allowed me to cut back on overthinking and making goals more easily attainable. I need to internalize this more knowledge and I hope that with my new method of studying and attacking projects that I will see a difference.
